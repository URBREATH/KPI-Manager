<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

The KPI Manager (part of the Digital Enabler platform) is designed to track, analyze, and manage key performance indicators effectively.  
Its primary purpose is to provide insights into the performance of various aspects of an organization, a project, a solution, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.  
It acts as a central hub for aggregating data from various sources. By consolidating data from disparate systems and databases, the KPI Manager provides a unified view of performance metrics.  
Through intuitive visualization tools such as dashboards, charts, and graphs, KPI Manager presents KPIs in a clear and accessible manner. This allows stakeholders to quickly see trends, patterns, and outliers within the data, facilitating informed decision-making.

After clicking "SAVE," the next step is to define the KPI in detail by setting the ideal value, choosing the unit of measure, and linking relevant measures or existing KPIs that will contribute to the calculation of this KPI. Here's how to complete the definition step:

### 1. Enter the Description:

- In the "Description" field, provide a brief summary of what this KPI measures to help others understand its purpose.

### 2. Set the Target Value:

- Input the target value in the "Target Value" field.
- Select the appropriate unit of measure (e.g., meters, liters, percentage) from the "Unit Measure" dropdown.

### 3. Link Measures or KPIs:

- Under the "Measures" or "KPIs" tab, search for and select existing measures or KPIs to link to this new KPI.

### 4. Map Integration (Optional):

If your KPI has a geographic position, use the map section to select or visualize relevant locations. This can be useful for KPIs related to regional performance or location-specific metrics. To access the map integration feature:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76484403-e140-4409-849f-00a639a09e08)

### 1. Opening the Map:

- Focus on the map section on the right side of the screen.
- Click on the target icon located next to the map. This action opens a larger map interface.

### 2. Selecting a Location:

- In the map interface, you can either click directly on the map to drop a pin or manually enter the latitude and longitude coordinates in the respective fields.
- The location you select will be marked with a blue pin on the map, indicating the geographic point associated with your KPI.

### 3. Saving the Location:

- After selecting the desired location, click on the "SAVE" button to associate this location with your KPI.
- The selected location will then appear in the map section on the "Definition" page.

### 4. Removing a Location:

- If you decide that the location is no longer relevant to the KPI, you can easily remove it by clicking on the bin icon next to the map.
- This action will clear the map of the selected location and reset the fields.

### 5. Review and Continue:

- Once all details are filled in, review the information for accuracy.
- Click "CONTINUE" to proceed to the next step, which involves setting up the formula, the dashboard visualization, and the final summary for the KPI.

<h3 id="writing-kpis-formula">5. Writing KPI’s Formula</h3>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e76170fc-7c8c-4181-aebf-25187770ea82)

After defining your KPI, the next crucial step is to create the formula that will be used to calculate the KPI values. The formula is constructed using the measures you have linked to the KPI during the definition phase. Here’s a detailed guide on how to create a valid KPI formula:

### 1. Drag and Drop a Measure:

- In the "Formula" step, you will see a list of available measures on the right-hand side under the "KPI/Measures" section.
- To add a measure to your formula, click and drag the measure's name and drop it into the "KPI Formula" field on the left.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d27d463-2510-4081-8c4d-12266f70dbab)

### 2. Selecting an Operation:

- Once you drop the measure into the formula field, a drop-down menu will automatically appear, allowing you to select an operation to apply to the measure.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/892a8ad8-d355-4fed-8590-6758ec783f9d)

- Available operations include:
  - Max (max): Maximum value.
  - Min (min): Minimum value.
  - Median (med): Median value.
  - Mean (μ): Average value.
  - Mode (Mo): Most frequent value.
  - Standard Deviation (σ): Measure of variability.
  - Sum (Σ): Total sum of the values.
- Click on the desired operation to add it to the formula.

### 3. Previewing the Formula:

- After constructing your formula, you can click the "PREVIEW" button to see a preview of how the formula will be applied.
- The preview helps ensure that your formula is correct before moving on to the next step.

### 4. KPI Scheduling:

- o Below the formula field, you can set how often the KPI calculation should be updated by specifying the time interval (e.g., every 12 hours).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c502f140-c5cf-43cb-abfa-4599a3c7558d)

### 5. Completing the Formula Step:

- Ensure that the formula field contains at least one measure and an associated operation.
- Once the formula is correctly configured, you can proceed to the next step by clicking on "NEXT" or proceed to customize the dashboard.

### Important Notes

- **Formula Validation**:  
  The system requires at least one measure to be added to the formula for it to be valid. If the formula field is empty or incomplete, you will not be able to proceed to the next step.

- **Multiple Operations**:  
  You can drag and drop additional measures into the formula field and apply different operations, allowing for complex KPI calculations.

- **Error Checking**:  
  If there is an issue with the formula, such as a missing measure or operation, the interface will display a warning, prompting you to correct the formula before proceeding.

These steps ensure that your KPI is calculated correctly based on the available data, allowing for accurate and meaningful performance tracking. Once satisfied with the formula, you can continue to the dashboard customization to visualize the KPI data effectively.

<h3 id="selecting-kpis-dashboard">6. Selecting KPI’s Dashboard</h3>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c1d7068-7987-4b5f-81f9-081875c68909)

The dashboard section allows you to select the type of chart that best suits the data and provides an effective visual summary of the KPI's performance. Here’s how to select the dashboard for your KPI:

### 1. Choosing a Chart Type:

In the "Dashboard" step, you are presented with several chart options on the left side of the screen. The available chart types include:

- **Bar**: Ideal for comparing values across different time periods or categories.
- **Area**: Emphasizes the magnitude of change over time, showing cumulative totals.
- **Line**: Useful for tracking changes over intervals of time, especially for trends.
- **Doughnut**: Suitable for showing proportions or percentages among categories.

### 2. Previewing the Chart:

- After selecting a chart type, a preview of the chart will appear on the right side of the screen. This preview shows how your KPI data will be displayed in the chosen format.
- The chart will automatically populate with the data calculated based on your formula, allowing you to see real-time changes as you switch between different chart types.

### 3. Adjusting and Finalizing the Chart:

- Review the chart in the preview to ensure it accurately represents your KPI data.
- If necessary, you can go back and modify the formula or the data inputs if the chart doesn’t meet your needs.
- Once satisfied with the visual representation, click "CONTINUE" to proceed to the final step.

### 4. Proceeding to the Summary:

- After finalizing the chart selection, clicking "CONTINUE" will take you to the "Summary" section where you can review all settings before saving the KPI.

Selecting the right dashboard visualization ensures that your KPI is effectively communicated to stakeholders, making the data both accessible and actionable.
