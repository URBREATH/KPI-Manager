![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e76170fc-7c8c-4181-aebf-25187770ea82)

After defining your KPI, the next crucial step is to create the formula that will be used to calculate the KPI values. The formula is constructed using the measures you have linked to the KPI during the definition phase. Here’s a detailed guide on how to create a valid KPI formula:

### 1. Drag and Drop a Measure:

- In the "Formula" step, you will see a list of available measures on the right-hand side under the "KPI/Measures" section.
- To add a measure to your formula, click and drag the measure's name and drop it into the "KPI Formula" field on the left.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d27d463-2510-4081-8c4d-12266f70dbab)

### 2. Selecting an Operation:

- Once you drop the measure into the formula field, a drop-down menu will automatically appear, allowing you to select an operation to apply to the measure.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/892a8ad8-d355-4fed-8590-6758ec783f9d)

- Available operations include:
  - Max (max): Maximum value.
  - Min (min): Minimum value.
  - Median (med): Median value.
  - Mean (μ): Average value.
  - Mode (Mo): Most frequent value.
  - Standard Deviation (σ): Measure of variability.
  - Sum (Σ): Total sum of the values.
- Click on the desired operation to add it to the formula.

### 3. Previewing the Formula:

- After constructing your formula, you can click the "PREVIEW" button to see a preview of how the formula will be applied.
- The preview helps ensure that your formula is correct before moving on to the next step.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c502f140-c5cf-43cb-abfa-4599a3c7558d)

### 5. Completing the Formula Step:

- Ensure that the formula field contains at least one measure and an associated operation.
- Once the formula is correctly configured, you can proceed to the next step by clicking on "NEXT" or proceed to customize the dashboard.

### Important Notes

- **Formula Validation**:  
  The system requires at least one measure to be added to the formula for it to be valid. If the formula field is empty or incomplete, you will not be able to proceed to the next step.

- **Multiple Operations**:  
  You can drag and drop additional measures into the formula field and apply different operations, allowing for complex KPI calculations.

- **Error Checking**:  
  If there is an issue with the formula, such as a missing measure or operation, the interface will display a warning, prompting you to correct the formula before proceeding.

These steps ensure that your KPI is calculated correctly based on the available data, allowing for accurate and meaningful performance tracking. Once satisfied with the formula, you can continue to the dashboard customization to visualize the KPI data effectively.
